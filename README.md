# Marcomms-Rolling

UPDATE
This repo has been brought under the WordPress organization at the end of Jan 2022. It has been merged with the [new Marketing-Tasks board in the Marketing-Team repo] https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/21. 

If you are creating new cards, please do this directly on the new Marketing-Team board and not on the repos marked for migration, such as this one.

Due to a number of bugs occuring during migration and from the new board system, some of the cards are being moved manually. If your card is not displaying on the new board, please advise, and share the original link for the card. It is anticipated to archive this repository by the end of March 2022 - a question is currently with GitHub supports on whether links to work done under this repo for record will continue to work once it is archived. Thank you for your assistance with this.
