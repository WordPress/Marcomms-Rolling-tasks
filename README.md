# Marcomms-Rolling
This is a place to produce, store and collborate on all WP Marcomms tasks that are needed on an ongoing rolling basis. 
Including:
- [Agendas](https://github.com/wpmarketingteam/Marcomms-Rolling-tasks/issues/6) (for weekly meetings)
- Notes and actions
- WPDiversity events promotions (for Community Team)
- Month in WordPress newsletter (for Community Team)
- Update posts
- Quarterly reporting/ annual review posts

For tasks relating to Meetups, please go to the [Meetup Repository](https://github.com/wpmarketingteam/Marcomms-Meetups/projects). This includes the Meetup newsletter (for Community Team). When meetups go back to in-person meetups, this repository is likely to be merged with the Marcomms-rolling repository.
