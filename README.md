# Marcomms-Rolling
Pilot - part of the contributing roadmap. 
This is a place to produce, store and collborate on all WP Marcomms tasks that are needed on an ongoing rolling basis. 
Including:
- [Agendas](https://github.com/wpmarketingteam/Marcomms-Rolling-tasks/issues/6) (for weekly meetings)
- Notes and actions (need to include the Slack link to the start of the meeting on the Marketing blog - aka as the P2)  
- WPDiversity events promotions (for Community Team)
- Month in WordPress newsletter (for Community Team)
- Meetup newsletter (with Community Team)
- Planned posts on the Marketing P2 (other than agendas and notes) 
- Other Make Teams requests
- Update posts (pending access issues being resolved)
- Quarterly reporting/ annual review posts (for Josepha/ Chloe - requested every three months)

For tasks relating to Meetups, please go to the [Meetup Repository](https://github.com/wpmarketingteam/Marcomms-Meetups/projects). This includes the Meetup newsletter (for Community Team). When meetups go back to in-person meetups, this repository is likely to be merged with the Marcomms-rolling repository.
